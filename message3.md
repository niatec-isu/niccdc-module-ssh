You're doing great team!

We've heard rumors that there is some way to implement a form of [Multi-Factor Authentication](hints/mfa.md) on our SSH server.
It has something to do with requiring an SSH key first then asking for a password.
Could you figute this out for us?

Thanks again for everything!
