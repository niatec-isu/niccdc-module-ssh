Great job team!

We've still been seeing some unauthorized access on the SSH server.
We want to further lock down this server by only allowing certain users to log in through SSH.
These users should be John, Jacob, Jingheheimer, and Schmidt.
We'd like to [create a group](hints/group-create.md) called `remote`, and [add these users](hints/group-add.md) to it.
Then, we'd like to configure SSH to [only allow connections](hints/allow-group.md) from users in this group.

Thanks again!
Once you've completed this task, we have one last [challenge](message3.md) for you.
